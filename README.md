# Bike_Sharing_Regression_Model
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic.The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario.So, it has decided to come up with a mindataframeul business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

## General Information
- They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends.
- Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:
- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands.
- day.csv is the dataset used.

## Conclusions
- temp is a feature that is most considered by people while opting the bike-sharing service.
- As we only have data of 2years we can conclude that the company has performed better than last year i.e.., the company has performed well in 2019 compared to 2018.
- As the company is aiming to post covid scenario the factors that might influence their market are temp,season,weekend and will have high demand in few months based on weather situation and other factors.
- Post covid market will surely be impacted by sanitization of vehicles which is not included in the past years so this might also be a deciding factor which is to be considered by the comoany in coming future.
